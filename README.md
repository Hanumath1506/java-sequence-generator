# Java Sequence Generator

A Java program that generates and displays numeric sequences using basic algorithmic logic.

## Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and method structure. The program generates a sequence of numbers based on predefined logic and outputs the result to the console.

## Features
- Generates a numeric sequence
- Displays sequence output clearly
- Simple and easy-to-understand logic

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Control Flow (loops and conditionals)
- Basic Algorithms

## Project Structure
